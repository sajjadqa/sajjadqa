## Running end-to-end tests using Cypress

(2) Run npm install in root directory.

(3) Change directory cd e2e/Cypress

(4) Open Cypress by running command: npx cypress open

### Prerequisite:

Node should be installed in your system.



Node installation:
To install Node.js and npm from the NodeSource repository, follow these steps:

(1) Enable the NodeSource repository by running the following curl as a user with sudo privileges:
#### curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -

The command will add the NodeSource signing key to your system, create an
apt sources repository file, install all necessary packages and refresh
the apt cache.

If you need to install another version, for example 13.x, just change setup_12.x with setup_13.x

(2) Once the NodeSource repository is enabled, install Node.js and npm by typing:
#### sudo apt install nodejs

The nodejs package contains both the node and npm binaries.

(3) Verify that the Node.js and npm were successfully installed by printing their versions:
#### node --version
v10.16.3
#### npm --version
6.9.0
